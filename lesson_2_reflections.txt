What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init creates invisible files that stores the state of the various files when a commit occurs

You need to initialize the repo, add the files with git add, and then commit the repo to create the first snapshot


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place to add files that need to be in the repository. The repository keeps track of the states of those files. The working directory is the area that has all of the above: staging area, files, repository


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- When you have made a logical change add the file to the staging area by using git add. Then use git commit to add the file to the repo.
