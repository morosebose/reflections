When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you are working with multiple coders on a single project
- When you want to back up stuff


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you might be working locally on a feature that you have committed locally but not pushed up yet
