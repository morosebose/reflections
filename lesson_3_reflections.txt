When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you are working with multiple coders on a single project
- When you want to back up stuff


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you might be working locally on a feature that you have committed locally but not pushed up yet


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: To make an exact copy of a repository on the GitHub server to my own GitHub account. 
Clones: To make an exact copy of a repository on the GitHub server or my local machine to to my local machine.
Branches: when I am planning to work on an experimental feature or an upgrade which isn't ready to be made public yet. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Enables fast forward merges
- Allows offline work by keeping track of changes between remote and local
- If changes are made both to remote and local, the point of divergence is known
